                <h3>Long term goals</h3>
                    <p>A long term goal that I have is I want to make enough money to take care of my mom so she does not have to work as much. To achieve this goal I want to go to a four year university. I want to go to UCLA preferably. I want to become either a vet or math professor. Preferably a math professor.</p>
                <h3>Short term goals</h3>
                    <p>A short term goal I have is I want to build a computer from scratch and learn how to code in Java. I want to learn to build a computer because it makes playing games on the pc cheaper. It is always good to find a cheaper way for a hobby. I also want to learn how to code Java because I like learning different kinds of codes I know Python already and it is fun of the product I can create.</p>
